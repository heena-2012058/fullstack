            <h3 style="color:white;">Door security system using secret knock pattern and facial recognition</h3>
            <p style="color:white;">Security is a major concern in our day-to-day life. Around us, breaking into homes and thefts are increasing day by day, therefore, introduction of digital locks have become an important part in these security systems. This project is based on Arduino Uno board and IOT. This lock works based on the knocking pattern and facial recognition using ESP-32 camera module. The owner’s knocking pattern is stored in the register. The knocking pattern is detected and passed onto the Arduino Uno and ESP – 32 camera module recognizes the face of the person trying to unlock the door. If the knocking pattern matches the correct pattern and the recognized face is of an Authorized person, the onboard LED is turned ON and the lock is opened. If the user forgets the pattern or the face is not recognized , an otp will be sent to the user’s mobile phone using blynk  app and the user may reset the pattern, This framework is easy for installation. It can be implemented for commercial use also.
